# Open Weather App

## About the Project:
The goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard. In this dashboard, one should be able to search for a city and recieve the current weather data and a five-day forecast. This dashboard will also enable the user to search for previously-searched cities.

## Challenges:
The most challenging piece of functionality to create was the recent search buttons. It took some time to think through the ways to structure the local storage data.
