# Open Weather App

## About the Project:
The goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard. In this dashboard, one should be able to search for a city and recieve the current weather data and a five-day forecast. This dashboard will also enable the user to search for previously-searched cities.

## Challenges:
The most challenging piece of functionality to create was the recent search buttons. It took some time to think through the ways to structure the local storage data.
It was also quite challenging to find a work-around to the mixed-content error that resulted from using Open Weather API's free version using http instead of https.
